    <p>Considered the champagne of teas (not my personal opinion, but a matter
    of history), Darjeeling can range from light and flavorful to dark and heavy
    depending on the flush, leaf, estate, and so on. But much of how it turns out

    pot of what is often referred to as the finest of teas.</p>
